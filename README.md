# ResearchProject
Code for my thesis and my progress
My most modern one is FindChessboardRealTimeTwoCamera.py
My progress started with ResearchProject.py
It then went to DLT.py, then to FindChessboard.py, then to FindChessboardRealTime, then finally to FindChessboardRealTimeTwoCamera.py.

All the other files are either helper files, or one time files I used to try something out that didn't work out or was then used in the main projects.
